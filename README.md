triangle_arbitrage
==================

The idea of the triangle_arbitrage file is derived from the UVa OJ 104. I have extended the problem by involving the bid ask spread  mechanism to simulate a more realistic situation.

The code gives the trading strategy for triangle arbitrage and the payoff of the strategy for certain initial investment.


the sample input is:
